##   MY AIM , THOUGHT PROCESS & INFLUENCE
My aim was to create a 'clean' and 'simple' one pager to quickly introduce myself to the reader.
My initial thought process was to start from a blank canvas and add elements to it.

When it comes to 'clean', i exploited white spaces as in a blank canvas and let the elements standout by using colour contrast for the elements I've put in.

To keep it 'simple', i have allowed no more than 5 different major colours in each section. The major colours were based on my lifestyle photos - White, blue, brown, black/grey. I believe the lesser colours there are, the more focus the audience would be onto the content after being visually stimulated by the simplicity of colours on a page.

Furthermore, I ensured text in each section is concise such that the reader be able to get to know me in ~20 seconds per section.

In terms of contents, started with what I want in each section and added my personality to it. Depicting what is my purpose was, why did I do coding - to make a difference. I loved superhero movies and I added that theme to the headings and the contents. Like with every superhero movie the flow of the story goes like its origin story (who am i), their powers (my skills) , saving the world (my past projects) and their alter ego (my personality on the web).

Furthermore, heroes usually operate behind the scenes. Hence I've added the parallax effect to add the sense of suspense and depth.


## BUILD PROCESS
I had a initial sketch of what i want my website to be below:
![Home page](https://github.com/iankhor/iankhor.github.io/blob/master/reference/initial%20sketch.jpg)

I further gotten inspiration on the style of my website from several of the following images:

Initially I started with pure CSS to get an understanding of how HTML & CSS interacts. Noticing that if I would require to code my webpage responsive design and the timeline of 1 week to complete a webpage, I decided to use the Bootstrap CSS framework to rapid prototype the second iteration of my webpage.

Bootstrap certainly helped along the way and I was more focused of the finer details of the webpage for a more immersive experience for the reader.

## SECTIONS

### LANDING PAGE/SECTION
I knew that this section I had to use a wide landscape picture. I intentionally cropped the picture such that only my body and the backdrop is in view to provide the reader a sense of suspense and providing the urge to see how or who am I in the next section. In a small screen, the user will still be able to see me in the background.

My name and three job title of my previous career would quickly describe what I have done before.

### ABOUT ME (TITLED : ORIGINS)
This goes more indepth of who i really am in short concise burst of text. Structured in the following:
1. Prior experience
2. Current intention / Brief one-liner mission statement
3. What i expect/want to do in the future

### SKILLS (TITLED : SUPERPOWERS)
This section illustrated my (current & future) web development skills and also highlight some of my prior skills.My web development skills are quickly highlighted via icons and my prior skills were described in words to give the reader a contrast. I believe the icons are eye catching which is intentional.

### PROJECTS (TITLED : SAVING THE WORLD)
I intended to highlight the top 4 project I have to date. The transitions when hovering over the picture allows the use the get the name of the project and the skills used.

### CONTACT ME
Currently allows my reader to reach me via twitter, linkedin, instgram or github.

### OTHER
Metatags and a sitemap was added


## SPECIAL EFFECTS TO OBSERVE

2. In the "Saving the world" section which describe my past projects, hover over the images to see transitions
3. Parallax effects
4. Elements wrap around when using small screen (ie: mobile)
5. On the top of the page, text shadow was added to further highlight my name when the white text is hovering over my shirt on a small screen.
